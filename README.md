STRIKE Universe is a creative, futuristic-themed website designed using only HTML and CSS. It features a fully responsive layout with a modern AI-inspired color palette—vibrant cyans, electric blues, and neon violets—reflecting the energy and innovation of machine and AI technology.

## Features

- **Pure HTML & CSS:** No JavaScript, images, or external assets are used. All animations, colors, and layout effects are implemented with HTML and CSS only.

- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach ensures optimal viewing experience across mobile phones, tablets, and desktops with fluid grids and adaptable typography.

- **AI-inspired Color Palette:** Uses a vibrant, modern color scheme inspired by AI technology—electric blue, neon violet, and bright cyan gradients to create a dynamic and engaging visual identity.

- **Cosmic Background:** The background uses layered radial gradients combined with animated "stars" created purely with CSS, providing a deep space atmosphere while remaining lightweight and scalable.

- **Animated Effects:** Includes flickering hero text, glowing brand logo animation, gentle bouncing feature icons, and subtle twinkle animations for stars—all powered by CSS keyframe animations.

- **Clear Sections:** The site includes three main content areas:
  - Home (Hero section with headline, tagline, and call-to-action)
  - Features (Highlighting three key features with icons and descriptions)
  - About (Team introduction with member cards)
  - Contact (Simple contact form for user engagement)

- **Accessible & Semantic:** Uses semantic HTML tags for clear structure and accessibility, with easy navigation and keyboard focus styles.

- **Navigation:** Sticky navigation bar with smooth visual feedback using underline transitions and color changes, enhancing user experience.
